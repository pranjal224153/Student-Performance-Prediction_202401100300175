# Student-Performance-Prediction_202401100300175
Data Loading & Preprocessing: We created a dataset and checked for missing values.
Model Training: We split the data into training and testing sets and used Linear Regression to train the model.
Prediction: We allowed users to input their own data and predict final exam scores.
Visualization: We visualized the relationship between study hours and exam scores, along with the regression line.
This code is a simple implementation of a linear regression model to predict student performance. The main goal is to predict the final exam score based on study hours and previous exam scores.
